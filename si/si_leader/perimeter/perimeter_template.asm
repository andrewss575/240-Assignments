;This program will help you with adding and subtracting in assembly
;
;PART1
;Our goal is to calculate the perimeter of a large 4-sided garden, with
;the value of sides as follows: 23,654 ft, 10,340 ft, 15,120 ft, and 19,345 ft
;
;PART2
;A student wants to find the difference between the fourth side(19,345) minus the first side(23,654)
;Find the difference for them and store it into a variable




;TODO: In section .data, initialize all the needed variables for the problem. Initialize your difference variable between
;side 4 and 1 as a double-word
