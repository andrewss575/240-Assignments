This folder has the following programs:

PrintWoMacro - How to print onto the terminal WITHOUT Macro
PrintWMacro - How to print onto the terminal WITH Macro
ReadWMacro - How to read from the terminal WITH Macro

I included these files because the professor is most likely to use 
these macros in quizes/assignments/projects/. I believe he also uses
macros to conver ascii to int

I included the lst files when we are using macros here because it's 
important to look at how macros work behind the scenes when the 
assembly file is assembled. What is happening is that when we call a 
mcaro in the asm file, that line essentially gets replaced with a 
"copy-and-paste" of the macro itself but with the given arguments 
instead of %1 and %2. THis is different from functions(which we will 
learn later on), where functions don't copy and paste code, instead 
they move the next line of instruction to the start of wherever the 
function is defined
